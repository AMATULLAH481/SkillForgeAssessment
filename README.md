# SkillForgeAssessment
The first file to run is the index.html file where the basic requirements of the assessment are located. Clicking on each box with a name in it takes to its page and the pages have been named according to the basic requirements.
Page 1 after index = Create Account; I gave the user some details to fill about themselves and also included error handling, such that if they did not fill some fields, they would not be allowed to progress.
Page 2 after index = Update account; The same steps taken in Page 1 after index where taken here except that some of the informaton from the create account was not needed in the update account page. Error handling also occured here inclduing for empty fields and fields with phone-number digitd=s less than 11.
Page 3 after the index = Delete Account , same procedure with Page 1 and 2 after index with exception handling and a go back button like the others.
Page 4 after the index page = Send money; User cannot send money without filling necessary details, so the error j=handling was implemented here too.
Page 5 after index= View transactions; This is basically a page that allows user's to see their transactions and account balance. It is non-editable and static with the exception of the go back button.
